# ML-Algorithms
It contains supervised, unsupervised and many other machine learning algorithms, implemented using both predefined sklearn modules and also from scratch.

Supervised algorithms are linear regression, logistic regression, KNearest NEighbour, Support Vector Machine.
Unsupervised algorithms are KMeans, Mean Shift.
Dimensinality reduction algorithms are Principal Component Analysis.

All of these algorithms are implemented from scratch along with pre defined sklearn modules for thes algorithms.
